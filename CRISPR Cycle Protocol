2018-6-25 Defined spacer acquisition (DSA) pilot experiment

1.  From cryostock, streak out E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔCR-I, GRA (ΔCRISPR-I, gfp(rev)-array) strain harboring pCas12 onto LB + Chlo (15 mL and 15 µL) plate, grow overnight

2.  Start liquid cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔCR-I, GRA (ΔCRISPR-I, gfp(rev)-array) strain harboring pCas12 from plates and grow overnight at 37°C

3.  In the morning, dilute the overnight grown culture 1:30 (100 µl) in 3 mL fresh LB containing 25 μg/mL Chlo (3 µl of the 1000x 25 mg/mL stock) and 100 ng/uL aTc (3 µl from 1000x stock), and grow for an additional 2 h at 37°C.
    - we can try 2, 4, 6 h for this step to increase DSA efficiency)
    - need to make a separate dilution for every replicate (10 total) 

4.  During induction, PREP: 
    - centrifuge (4˚ C) 
    - ice 
    - dH20
    - Chlo & oligos
    - empty eppendorfs for washes 
    - post-electroporation LB+Chlo media for each replicate
    - New 1000 & 200 tip boxes

5.	Spin down cells (1 mL of culture) and resuspend and wash in 1 mL ice-cold water *three times* to remove residual media
    - centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C
    - last wash, add extra minute at max RPM 

6.	Resuspend cells in 50 μL (per 1 mL of 3 mL culture) of cold water containing fwd and rev oligo strands* each at a concentration of 3.125 μM, and electroporate with a Bio-rad gene pulser set to 1.8 kV, 25 μF, and 200 Ω. 
    - we can try 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 μM for this step to increase DSA efficiency
    - switch the electroporation wires to the right machine for expt
    - tap the cuvettes to bring solution down between metal plates, dry off before electroporation

7.  Immediately following electroporation, resuspend cells in 3 mL fresh LB+Chlo, and recover cells for overnight
    - switch the electroporation wires back to the left afterwards

8.  Repeat 3 times



NOTE: PREPPING THE OLIGOS 

*Defined spacer oligo
psAA33 positive control:
psAA33(fwd): 5’AAGCCCAATTTACTACTCGTTCTGGTGTTTCTCGT
psAA33(rev): 5’ACGAGAAACACCAGAACGAGTAGTAAATTGGGCTT

T7 promoter:
T7 (fwd): 5’AAGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGCGGGAT
T7 (rev): 5’ATCCCGCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTT

1.	Mix 50 μM of each of fwd and rev oligos in 1:1 ratio, heat at 95C then slowly cool down to room temp to anneal oligos and get 25 μM of defined spacer oligo solution.
    ##Note – made 50 µM stocks by resuspending the ordered oligos in (2xng x 10) µl nuclease free water, vortexing & putting on heat block & repeating til dissolved
2.	2-fold serial dilution (500 µl to 500 µl water) to get 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 μM concentrations
3.	Store at -20°C
