2.	In the morning, spin down 500 uL of the overnight grown culture at max rpm for 1 min at room temp, discard supernatant, and store cell pellet at -20C [Label this tube “Day0”]
3.	dilute the overnight grown culture 1:30 in 3 mL fresh LB containing 25 μg/mL Chlo (1000x stock: 3 uL into 3 mL) and 100 ng/uL aTc (1000x stock: 3 uL into 3 mL), and grow for an additional 2 h at 37°C. [dilute the overnight grown culture into 7 different tubes]
